Documentation: adaptive movement contrasts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------
- functions are stored in functions_adaptive_movement_contrasts.py
- markers are calculated in behavior_to_EEG_adaptive_movement_contrasts.ipynb

- needed to execute scripts:
	- .Markers files exported from BVA after deleting practice interval
	- behavioral data in folder structure according to subject & task (preprocessed by R-script R:\AG-Beste-Studien\Emulation\06_analysis\r_scripts) --> folder consists of one file per trial + one overview file

- output: 
	- new .txt marker files for every subjects --> import in BVA for segmentation etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- functions for calculating 4 types of events:
	maximum of error curve
	minimum of error curve
	direction change in pursuit
	direction keep in pursuit (space between two peaks)

- find time points for match of these events for calculating contrasts based on behavioral data:
0	errormax & dirchange		= adaptive movement		= contrast_1 > 0 & contrast_2 = True 
1	errormax & dirkeep 		= no adaptive movement		= contrast_1 > 0 & contrast_2 = False
2	errormin & dirchange		= "false" adaptation		= contrast_1 = -1 & contrast_2 = True
3	errormin & dirkeep		= "good" dirkeep		= contrast_1 = -1 & contrast_2 = False

- after finding match of the events, transfer this to EEG samples to set markers

EXPLANATION ON FUNCTIONS
------------------------

behavioral_events_in_EEG_format
	pursuit is lowpass-filtered (cutoff = 0.05 units)
	filtered/original data are processed get_extrema --> depending on contrasts, min+max, only max or values between extrema are given
	samples (x) + samples_vals (y) are given --> check that there are at least 5 samples to both sides to only include "valid" points (min_ramps)
	calculate percentage of samples in behavioral dimension for every condition (to apply to EEG samples)

behavioral_events_to_EEG
	reads behavioral information + marker file and information on samples of each trial 
	loop for both contrasts: EEG samples for all 4 conditions are extracted
	matching samples for all 4 conditions are extracted
	for every subject, all 4 conditions are plotted
