script for adding triggers at timepoint of adaptive movements 

adaptive movement = maximum of error curve & direction change (minimum/ maximum) of pursuit at the same time 

steps:
	1) load behavioral data (preprocessed with r script) --> absolute error curve + pursuit data
	2) filter pursuit and error data --> lowpass filter 0.05 (Hz?)
	3) identify maxima (and minima if pursuit) of error curve and pursuit data
		minimum value for ramp up/down: 7 samples (~100 ms) to ensure no overlapping events + no random movement
	4) identify EEG sample to synchronize data
	5) select 10 biggest maxima of error curve and ... of pursuit
	6) search for matching samples, indicating error maximum AND direction change (with tolerance of 30 (~500 ms) samples 	before and after ...)
